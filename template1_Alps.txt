Geological History:
The Alps were formed through a series of mountain-building processes over millions of years, starting from about 65 million years ago during the Mesozoic Era. They have undergone multiple cycles of uplift and erosion that are still active today. During the Alpine orogeny in the late Paleogene period (around 30 to 40 million years ago), these mountains experienced significant crustal deformation leading to their current high peaks and deep valleys, which were shaped primarily by glaciation processes during the Quaternary Ice Ages.

Climate:
The Alps are known for a varied climate influenced by altitude, latitude, topography, and local geography. Temperatures decrease with increasing altitude in most parts of the mountain range. Average annual temperatures at lower elevations range from about 6°C to 12°C (43-54°F), while they can be as low as -2°C to 8°C (-20°F to 46°F) at higher altitudes, particularly above the tree line. Precipitation varies across the Alps, but generally ranges from about 1,000 mm/year in parts of Southern Europe to over 3,500 mm/year in mountainous areas near Scandinavia and Russia.

Effects of Climate Changes:
Current climate studies show that glaciers in the Alps have been losing mass for more than a century with rates accelerating in recent decades. Satellite data shows an average annual rate of loss from Alpine glaciers at about -1.4 m (3.8 ft) of thickness per year between 2000 and 2019, though regional variations exist; for example, the smaller Rhône Glacier lost a third more ice in that period than previous estimates had suggested. These shrinking glaciers impact water resources availability downstream as they feed into rivers like the Rhine, Danube, and Po. The retreat of these massive bodies of snow and ice also has implications for biodiversity with species dependent on cold environments moving to higher altitudes where suitable habitats remain stable under current climate scenarios.
