Geological History:
The Sahara, one of Earth's most extensive deserts, has experienced significant changes throughout its geological history due to tectonic movements, climate fluctuations, and shifting landmasses. Over millions of years, what is now the Sahara was once a lush green region, supporting vast ecosystems that included rainforests, lakes, and grasslands before gradually transforming into arid desert conditions.
The initial formation of the Sahara can be traced back around 30 million years ago during the Oligocene epoch when tectonic activity caused the African supercontinent to break up apart from South America. This led to the separation of North Africa from the southern landmass, which reduced moisture circulation between them and thus initiated aridification processes that shaped much of northern Africa over geologic time scales.
From approximately 8 million years ago during the Miocene period through about one million years before present, the Sahara witnessed a series of dramatic expansions and contractions in size, largely driven by fluctuations in regional rainfall patterns due to changes in atmospheric circulation influenced mainly by latitudinal shifts caused by tectonic events such as breakups of ancient supercontinents.
Throughout these geological periods, various human civilizations flourished within the Sahara at different times, indicating that while aridity is generally associated with this region today; there have been relatively wet periods where certain parts became habitable or agriculturally viable in history before transitioning back into its current desiccated state once again.

Geological History:
The climate of the Sahara can be characterized by extreme temperatures ranging from blistering heat during summer months averaging around 45-50°C (113-122°F) 
to relatively cooler winters dipping down towards freezing at night under clear skies in places like Algeria's Tassili n’Ajjer Mountains. Rainfall occurs mostly during short bursts during winter months, sometimes dropping hundreds of millimeters within hours resulting in flash floods or ephemeral river formation which eventually disappear underground as they flow into cracks and aquifers below the arid desert sand.

Effects of climate changes:
In recent times due to ongoing global climate change, the Sahara is experiencing increasingly variable rainfall patterns that are contributing towards destabilizing agricultural conditions leading to food shortages for nomadic populations living within this vast landscape; moreover increased temperatures have accelerated desiccation processes affecting fragile ecosystems such as semi-arid Sahel region directly south of the Sahara.
